/** 
    Added Validation ART_0038_portWithPredefinedProtocolNotCorrectlyDeclared
    Ports typed by a predefined protocol (Timing, Log, External, Exception or Frame) 
    cannot be used in the same way as ports that are typed by user-defined protocols.	
    For example, it does not make sense to connect such ports with connectors since no events can be sent to them. 
    Because of the following keywords are not applicable for such ports: notify, publish, subscribe, unwired
