This test ensures that protocol events are sorted alphabetically in the rt_signals array in the generated code. It shows how the TargetRTS functions RTProtocolDescriptor::inSignalNamed() and RTProtocolDescriptor::outSignalNamed() can be used for looking up the index of in-events and out-events in this array.
